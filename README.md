# Date Screener

Date Screener is a privacy-focused alternative to traditional dating apps. Instead of relying on algorithmic swiping or superficial attraction, it introduces a **trusted human layer**: your friends and family help "screen" your potential matches.

This app promotes meaningful connection, emotional safety, and compatibility by **removing the manipulation and gamification** common in modern dating platforms.

## 🧠 Concept

Modern dating apps often prey on loneliness, vanity, and impulsivity. Date Screener flips the script:
- **No swiping. No spam. No manipulation.**
- You choose a **Screener** — a trusted friend, sibling, or parent — to help you filter matches.
- Screeners answer a short, meaningful questionnaire about your values and preferences.
- Only **screened matches** are presented to you.

> _It’s dating with dignity — curated by those who know you best._
